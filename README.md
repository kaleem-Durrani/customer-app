## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# For web
yarn web
# For ios
yarn ios
# For android
yarn android
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `App.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`@gluestack-ui`](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/overview/introduction) library that provides optionally styled and accessible components. These components are designed for easy integration into applications developed with React and React Native.
